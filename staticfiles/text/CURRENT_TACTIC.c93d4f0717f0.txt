Notes

Map every 'word' to a list of 'criteria'. 'criteria' is in plain english.

Map every 'criteria' to a UNIQUE regex expression. This will have to be manual. 

In main program, for every FAILED word (or otherwise? is there any need to check successful words? perhaps JUST list the criteria?), perform:

1. criteria_map[word] -> get list of criteria.

2. for each criteria in criteria_map[word], perform regex_map[criteria].

3. using returned regex expression, use re.findall(pattern, word).

4. if empty, return criteria FAILED. perhaps a tuple? (criteria_plain_english, success_status).
